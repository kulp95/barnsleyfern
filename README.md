Investigates different computational methods for producing the Barnsley's Fern fractal. 3D and 2D Ferns are created, compared, and discussed.

Please read/run the notebooks in this order: 

1. 3D Barnsley's Fern
Begin here. This notebook includes background information on the Barnsley's Fern and uses code from Landau/Paez textbook to produce a 3D Barnsley's fern. This 3D variation on the Barnsley's Fern was created by Landau and Paez, so there is no outside reference code to compare it to (Barnsley's Fern is originally a two dimensional fractal). 

2. 2D Barnsley's Fern comparison
This notebook includes two versions of code that produce a 2D Barnsley's Fern using the original affine transformations and probabilities given by Michael Barnsley. The first version is what I adapted from the 3D Barnsley's Fern from Landau/Paez, and the second version is a published reference code from the Barnsley's Fern Wikipedia page. These versions are compared in order to verify that the first version is working as intended. 

Please let me know if you have any trouble with running the code. I found that sometimes the display does not show up (for 3D fern and first version of 2D fern), but is usually fixed by restarting the kernel.
