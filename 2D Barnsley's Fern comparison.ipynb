As a warning, the reference code (part **2.**) takes quite a while to draw the fern, even at maximum speed (about 5 minutes for 2000 points for me). I would recommend starting with something like **num_pts = 2000** when you are running the actual comparison/verification (when you need to generate and store all of the points and not interrupt it). \n",
